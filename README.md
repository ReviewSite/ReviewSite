## Deploying the ReviewSite to Heroku
When deploying to a new Heroku instance, please specify e-mail account settings in the following configuration
variables.

Account details for sending emails from:
* `MAIL_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com`
* `MAIL_PORT=587`
* `MAIL_DOMAIN=thoughtworks.org`
* `MAIL_USERNAME=do-not-reply@thoughtworks.org`
* `MAIL_PASSWORD=<password>`
* `MAIL_TLS=true`

The Address that should appear in the "from" line of the sent e-mails:
* `MAIL_FULL_EMAIL="TW ReviewSite <do-not-reply@thoughtworks.org>"`

The base domain that should be used for the links that appear in the emails.
* `DOMAIN=twreviewsite.herokuapp.com`

In order to prevent the mailer from sending e-mail on non-production heroku instance, 
it is possible to redirect all e-mail to an address that you control.
* `EMAIL_OVERRIDE=someone@somewhere.com`

Any dev questions can be sent to tw-review-site@thoughtworks.com and it will be seen by all members of the Review Site team.
